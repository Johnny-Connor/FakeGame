# About it

A game I made in just 4 days for [Brackeys Game Jam 2022.1](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-7). The theme was "It is not real" and it was the first Game Jam I've ever participated! You can play the game in your browser by clicking [here](https://johnny-connor.itch.io/fake-game).

# Development

In this jam, participants had 7 days to develop their games. I was busy in the first 3 days of the event, so I had only 4 days to make a game capable of competing with games made within a week. I knew that achieving this was going to be very challenging, so I decided to make a game capable of being very simple but addictive at the same time.

At first, everything was going well, but then I had to learn from scratch how to use Unity's Animator while making sure I would have enough time to finish, debug and publish the game! Because of that, I had to code even quicker by using the "go-horse" methodology after the first day of development or so, meaning that the game's code didn't end up as clean as I wanted it to be.

Despite of that, I made sure that the player's experience wouldn't get compromised at all, so you can expect having a clean, smooth and solid gaming experience!

# Results

1646 out of over 10.000 participants have submitted their games.

Despite believing that a game can't be defined by just a number, I got really happy with the fact that my game made it to the [very first page](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-7/results/fun) in the category that I consider the most important: fun! Here are the ratings I got in every category:

* Fun: #19
